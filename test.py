"""
Write a Python-script that:
1. Searches for files by a given pattern (pattern can include: *, ?)
2. Displays the search result
3. Gets access rights for each file that is found and displays the result

The script should have 2 obligatory functions:
- finder - a generator function searches for files by a given pattern
 in a given path returns an absolute path of a found file.
- display_result - displays founded files and files' permission
by a given list of absolute paths (You can find an example below).

Example call:
python task_3_ex_3.py /usr/bin -p '?ython*'

Example result:
...
/usr/bin/python3.6m -rwxr-xr-x
/usr/bin/python3.7m -rwxr-xr-x
Found 12 file(s).

Note: use of glob module is prohibited.

Hint: use os.walk, stat, fnmatch
